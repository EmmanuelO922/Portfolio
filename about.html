    <p id="About">
      Recently, I have been reading the Legend series by Marie Lu, and I am current reading the last book, Prodigy. I like to watch anime and play games with my sibling, but I prefer alone time. I sometimes code for fun or play my clarinet. I was recently elected as one of my student representatives at school and am now working with the Student Government.
